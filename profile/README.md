# PeacockProject

We build open software for phones.

We do this because we can.
Our goal is to provide clean tools, recovery options, and a Linux system you can use.

We care about control, repair, and learning by doing.
If you like testing on real hardware, digging into boot chains, and making broken things work again, you are in the right place.

## Why we do this

Devices are shackled by what their vendor thinks you should be doing with them, we try to open a path for you to really get on the driver's seat.
Good hardware still deserves good software.

## Join in

Open an issue, send a patch, or test on your device and report back.
Every real test helps.
